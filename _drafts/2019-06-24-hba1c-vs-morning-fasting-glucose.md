Since early February of this year, I have been tracking my morning fasting glucose almost daily. The only exceptions have been due to order issues (me timing a replacement order incorrectly) and a USPS failure. I have even done a few tests at other times (during fasts and as part of carb tolerance tests, as documented last week).

However, daily testing of glucose can get burdensome. The whole finger prick and drawing out the blood takes time. So I was wondering if there's a way for me to determine if I can trust HbA1c as a good measuring proxy for daily morning glucose and avoid poking myself everyday (Who am I kidding? Even if I am confident in HbA1c as a good proxy for morning glucose, I'll probably still poke myself every morning so I can see the variation).

# What is HbA1c?

I am sure that there other sources around the internet that would do a much better job of explaining HbA1c than I will (like here and here). However, for those of you who don't have any time to follow the links or do a search, here's a quick summary: HbA1c is a measure of the amount of red blood cells that have XXXX. Since red blood cells live an average of 90 to 120 days, it's considered to be a great tool for measuring the last 3 months of all glucose levels, not just fasting glucose.

Additionally, there has been some research in the last few years that has actually looked into showing an estimated Average Glucose (eAG) value as a result of the number on this test. Fortunately for me, I have been tracking my morning fasting glucose so I can compare it to those results as well. 

# Calculated HbA1c from Fasting Glucose

My average fasting glucose over the prior three months was 98. Although your fasting glucose measurements don't fully reflect the expected value of HbA1c, there's a simple calculation from a diabetes research journal that shows how to calculate average glucose from A1c.[^1] I used that to calculate what my estimated A1c would be for the prior three months: 5.0%

# Calculated eAG from HbA1c tests

As part of my HbA1c testing, I decided to test with three different services for HbA1c. A more detailed comparison of my results and experience will occur as part of a future post, but for now, here's the results: 

| Service | HbA1c | eAG |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| RequestATest | 5.4% | 108 |
| EverlyWell | 5.3% | 105 |
| LetsGetChecked | 5.2% | 103 |

RequestATest actually provided the eAG for me, but I used the formula to calculate the eAG for the other two.

# Final Thoughts

Here's my biggest conclusion from this simple experiment: Glucose measurements do decent job of getting an estimated A1c. I was only off by 7.4%, which is almost as good as the inter-lab variation between the home and in-lab draws (something I'll look at more next week). 

A few final thoughts on my testing for this post.

1. Estimating A1c from morning fasting glucose will definitely underestimate the A1c and the intraday glucose levels you've had. It's pretty basic that even if you're eating a low glycemic index diet, you will still have spikes in your glucose that you can't measure or understand by doing morning spot checks. 
2. Fasting glucose is still a nice spot check, but, for self-experimentation purposes, probably not the best metric. It's like getting the miles per gallon (or kilometers for all the rest of the world) at the end of a drive. It's valuable, but only useful for that ride and it's a retrospective view of the ride as a whole. HbA1c is more like getting the MPG after every fill up for all the rides on that fill up (still valuable) and continuous glucose monitoring is like getting MPG as you are driving (probably the most valuable for assessing specific actions). Still looking for some way to get a prescription for a CGM device. 
3. Testing just morning glucose (not glucose and ketones, like me) would probably make it almost the same price as testing HbA1c every 3 months, and if you're not good at shopping for test strips, A1c may actually be cheaper. This is assuming that you aren't trying to use insurance to cover either of these, which can make it nearly impossible to know which is more cost effective for you (thank you for the US healthcare system, but that's a separate issue). If I didn't care about getting daily updates so I know where to make adjustments, I would probably just get A1c every 3 months to see how things are trending.  

[^1]: The [article](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/diacare/early/2008/06/07/dc08-0545.full.pdf) gives the formula for calculating average glucose in mg/dL from A1c: $$AG = 28.7 x A1C - 46.7$$ Solving the formula for A1C, you get: $$A1C = (AG / 28.7) + 1.63
