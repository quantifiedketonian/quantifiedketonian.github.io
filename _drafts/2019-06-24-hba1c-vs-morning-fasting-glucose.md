Since early February of this year, I have been tracking my morning fasting glucose almost daily. The only exceptions have been due to order issues (me timing a replacement order incorrectly) and a USPS failure. I have even done a few tests at other times (during fasts and as part of carb tolerance tests, as documented last week).

However, daily testing of glucose can get burdensome. The whole finger prick and drawing out the blood takes time. So I was wondering 

# What is HbA1c?

I am sure that there other sources around the internet that would do a much better job of explaining HbA1c than I will (like here and here). However, for those of you who don't have any time to follow the links or do a search, here's a quick summary: HbA1c is a measure of the amount of red blood cells that have XXXX. Since red blood cells live an average of 90 to 120 days, it's considered to be a great tool for measuring the last 3 months of glucose levels.

Additionally, there has been some research in the last few years that has actually looked into showing an estimated Average Glucose (eAG) value as a result of the number on this test. Fortunately for me, I have been tracking my morning fasting glucose so I can compare it to those results as well.

# Calculated eAG from HbA1c tests

As part of my HbA1c testing, I decided to test with three different services for HbA1c. A more detailed comparison of my results and experience will occur as part of a future post, but for now, here's the results: 

| Service | HbA1c | eAG |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| RequestATest | 5.4% | 108 |
| EverlyWell | 5.3% |  |
| LetsGetChecked | 5.2% |  |
