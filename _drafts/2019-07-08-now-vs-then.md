Several years ago, I was working at a startup that was creating a personal health record. While there, I was given a few different devices that we had integrated into the system (for testing). One thing led to another and I really got into tracking a lot of different metrics, some of which were more useful than others. I even tracked my glucose measurements for a couple months. Now that I'm tracking it regularly again and I have something that I'd like to change, I wanted to take some time to see if my glucose levels had changed in 5 years and if they have, how have they changed. 

# Old Me vs New Me

Thankfully, I was tracking quite a few things back then as well so I can pretty easily find a comparative period in my more recent history. I was not tracking food religiously like I am now so I won't be able to compare food, but I do know that during this time, my wife and I were experimenting with Paleo. Also, I was using a different glucose meter than I am now (iHealth Align vs. KetoMojo), so if there's a significant difference between the two distributions, some of that could be due to the differences in accuracy between the two meters. With that said, here's a few metrics to describe the quantified version of "me".

| Metric | "Old" Me | "New" Me | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Average Sleep Time | | |
| # of Kids | 2 | 3 |
| Bike Commuting Likelihood on Any Day | | |
| Average "Steps"[^1] |  |  |
| Average Heart Rate[^2] | | | 

# Old Glucose vs New Glucose



[^1]: I'm not big into trusting that the steps that are calculated by one of those wrist-worn devices (Fitbit, Withings, etc.) are actually correct; I've seen too much research that makes me believe they're inconsistent at best. However, I have found that they do a decent job of helping me understand relative activity levels. Like glucose meters though, I have changed devices since then: Misfit/Basis vs. Withings
