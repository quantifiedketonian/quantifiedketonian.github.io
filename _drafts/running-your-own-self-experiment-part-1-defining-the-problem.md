The hardest part of running any self experiment is deciding what to focus on for an experiment. 

As a slightly OCD person, I would like to improve everything simultaneously. But if I did that, then it would be impossible to know what changes are having an effect and, eventually, nothing would improve.

So how do I decide where to start and what to focus on?

The first thing I always do is find something that's not quite right. It might sound extremely negative to always be looking for problems, but I'm a firm believer that there's always room for improvement. 

There's a few ways to find something that's not quite right. Most of the experiments I've done so far are a result of simply knowing that my health is not optimal and reading articles or listening to podcasts about areas of personal health improvement. This is why I started on the keto lifestyle originally. 

On top of my reading and listening, I'm also tracking tons of metrics. So outside of hearing about ways to improve, I will sometimes just look at my charts to find out if something isn't right. This is how I've identified that it might be a worth experimenting around time-restricted eating for improving my sleep. I discovered this by looking at my sleeping heart rate in my Withings and Oura Ring history and comparing it to my times for the last meal of the day. 

Once I identify a non-optimal area, the next step in defining the outcome metric and how I will measure it.

As I started researching the keto lifestyle, I knew that the metrics that I should care about were daily net carbs and fasting glucose and ketone levels (and using those to calculate GKI). I knew it would be easy to track net carbs inside of Cronometer. But tracking the glucose and ketone levels was a bit harder. That required buying a device, the KetoMojo meter, and building a habit (something I'll talk about in the next part) of tracking the metric.

When you're already tracking the metrics, like I am for the time-restricted eating experiment, it makes it really easy to define the metrics and figure out how to measure it (because I'm already doing it). 

But just knowing what the metric is and how to measure it isn't enough. You have to know what the desired outcome is. With keto, I knew that I wanted to be in ketosis, and preferably with a moderate level of ketosis, which is a GKI value of between 3 and 6. With the time-restricted eating, I know that I want to see if time-restricted eating improves my sleep scores (both Withings and Oura). I'd prefer to have a rolling average over 80 for both of them.

So now that I know what the problem is, what the metric is for tracking it, how to track it, and what my desired outcome is, I can start building the experiment plan. Time for Part 2.
