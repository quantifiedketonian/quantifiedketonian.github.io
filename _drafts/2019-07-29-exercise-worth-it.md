Exercise is widely touted as a great way to reduce glucose levels. I have also seen on other quantified self blogs that exercise has affected glucose values the next day and I wondered if the same would apply for me. 

Even still, I have never enjoyed exercise. As a teenager, I wrestled on the school team and played soccer and football, but the only exercise I did was whatever the coaches required at practice. However, in an effort to try all options for glucose management, over the past 6 months, I've tried 3 different exercise programs to measure their impact on my glucose levels the next morning. 

This post will probably feel similar to my previous post on HbA1c testing options because there's 3 "contenders" for best exercise program for glucose control (for me). However, this one is slightly different because it actually involves a more "scientific" analysis of the best program for me. 

# The Contenders

1. Regular Cycling - As part of my commute, I have been cycling on many days (not all though) about 30 minutes at a low pace. 
2. Strength Training - In preparation for a Spartan Race, I decided to get back into some regular weight lifting. I followed the Stronglifts 5x5 workout plan for 10 weeks. This is a 3 days a week workout plan.
3. HIIT Workouts - After 10 weeks of strength training, I took 2 weeks off (to try and prevent overlapping effects) before starting the "recommended" 5-week workout plan for preparing for a Spartan Race.

# The Experiment Design

Using my own experiment protocol guidelines, I want to make sure you understand what I did to determine which approach was best. My hypothesis was that strength training and HIIT workouts would have an effect, but that cycling would not because I was not pushing hard enough to deplete my muscle glycogen stores so the blood glucose levels would remain unchanged. I answered my protocol questions as follows:

1. **Length** - In preparing for this, I knew that I would run into daily life issues (i.e. some days I might have to do two of the three so that I could commute to work). My plan was to do each type of exercise program long enough to see if there would be any compounding effects (i.e. would the fact that I was working out regularly matter more than the fact that I worked out the day before). So I decided that a 5 week period would be the minimum amount of time that I would need to evaluate that. 
2. **Frequency** - I knew that I could track my commutes and my workouts very easily. In addition to the workout/no workout data and workout type for any given day, I also have very specific data for each workout, including time, heartrate, and reps/sets (strength training/HIIT). As mentioned previously, I have been tracking glucose and ketones religiously since early February of this year, with only a few exceptions due to poor planning and shipping issues. 
3. **Confounders** - As usual, I felt like this was the most difficult. I know from prior experience that my glucose levels are generally higher the morning after a high-carb day (non-Keto, I'm also doing an experiment on standard american diet and its effect on my glucose) so I knew that I needed to remove those days from my final dataset.

# The Battle



# The Outcome

Even after trying to control for as many confounders as I could in my everyday life, I still think I may take some time to dive into this more.
