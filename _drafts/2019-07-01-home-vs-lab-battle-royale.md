Everyone believes that the new fangled home labs tests can't be as accurate as the in-lab testing. As part of my HbA1c testing for the HbA1c vs Fasting Glucose post, I decided that I wanted to know if a one-time comparison of home HbA1c testing companies would help me understand the accuracy of the options available. So I did a quick experiment that would in no way be comparable to a scientific research project. 

# The Contenders

I used three different services to test my HbA1c:

1. RequestATest - A more established company that lets consumers order blood draws at LabCorp or Quest Diagnostics.
2. EverlyWell - A relatively new startup based in Austin, TX (you may have seen them on Shark Tank) that ships at-home tests to consumers.
3. LetsGetChecked - Another startup based in Ireland that ships at-home tests to consumers.

Each of these services has their own strengths and weaknesses.

# The Battle

## The Order

Ordering the tests from each company was an experience. They all had their own quirks. I ordered all of the tests on the same day.

1. RequestATest - Although the website looks like it was built in the 90's, it still functions pretty well. I didn't have any issues. There are hundreds of tests available for purchase. In fact, I almost felt like it was difficult to find an HbA1c test using the search tools. Once I found it, it was easy to complete the purchase and I could even make the payment with my HSA card directly. Once the order was placed, I received emails over the next two days confirming the order and informing me that the lab order had been sent electronically to LabCorp. Once I was ready, I could go online and schedule my appointment at LabCorp's location.
2. EverlyWell - The site design is great. Once I found the HbA1c option, the payment was very simple and I could use my HSA card directly. Once the order was placed, I received emails and texts over the next 7 days confirming the order, updating me on the shipment, and directions for signing up for an account. 
3. LetsGetChecked - The site design is great here as well, but there's not a very good description of what's included in a test until you're actually on the tests page. After looking around, I discovered that the Diabetes check is the test that includes just the HbA1c. I placed the order and couldn't use my HSA card (sadly). Over the next 4 days, they sent regular emails to keep me updated on the order status, shipment, and even a couple emails on how to take the test. 

## The Draw

I performed all of the draws on the same day, which meant that I had to wait until all of the packages and confirmations arrived. 

1. RequestATest - This was the most difficult of the three, but it was still very easy. It was a ten minute drive to the lab, a five minute wait, and a couple minutes to actually draw the blood. 
2. EverlyWell - This was probably the easiest. The website where you activate the kit has great videos for how to do the test. I poked my finger and dropped some blood onto a little strip. Once the blood was dry, I stuck it back in the shipping bag and sent it back. 
3. LetsGetChecked - The website was great for LetsGetChecked as well. There were lots of video tutorials as well. After poking my finger, I had drain my finger into a little tube. This took a bit of time because it was a felt like a lot of blood. After I got the blood in the tube, I put it in the shipping box and took it to UPS.
