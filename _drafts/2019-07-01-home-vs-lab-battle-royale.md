Everyone believes that the new fangled home labs tests can't be as accurate as the in-lab testing. As part of my HbA1c testing for the HbA1c vs. Fasting Glucose post, I decided that I wanted to know if a one-time comparison of home HbA1c testing companies would help me understand the accuracy of the options available. So I did a quick experiment that would in no way be comparable to a scientific research project. 

# The Contenders

I used three different services to test my HbA1c:

1. RequestATest - A more established company that lets consumers order blood draws at LabCorp or Quest Diagnostics.
2. EverlyWell - A relatively new startup based in Austin, TX (you may have seen them on Shark Tank) that ships at-home tests to consumers.
3. LetsGetChecked - Another startup based in Ireland that ships at-home tests to consumers.

Each of these services has their own strengths and weaknesses.

# The Battle

## The Order

Ordering the tests from each company was an experience. They all had their own quirks. I ordered all of the tests on the same day.

1. RequestATest - Although the website looks like it was built in the 90's, it still functions pretty well. I didn't have any issues. There are hundreds of tests available for purchase. In fact, I almost felt like it was difficult to find an HbA1c test using the search tools. Once I found it, it was easy to complete the purchase and I could even make the payment with my HSA card directly. Once the order was placed, I received emails over the next two days confirming the order and informing me that the lab order had been sent electronically to LabCorp. Once I was ready, I could go online and schedule my appointment at LabCorp's location.
2. EverlyWell - The site design is great. Once I found the HbA1c option, the payment was very simple and I could use my HSA card directly. Once the order was placed, I received emails and texts over the next 7 days confirming the order, updating me on the shipment, and directions for signing up for an account. 
3. LetsGetChecked - The site design is great here as well, but there's not a very good description of what's included in a test until you're actually on the tests page. After looking around, I discovered that the Diabetes check is the test that includes just the HbA1c. I placed the order and couldn't use my HSA card (sadly). Over the next 4 days, they sent regular emails to keep me updated on the order status, shipment, and even a couple emails on how to take the test. 

## The Draw

I performed all of the draws on the same day, which meant that I had to wait until all of the packages and confirmations arrived. 

1. RequestATest - This was the most difficult of the three, but it was still very easy. It was a ten minute drive to the lab, a five minute wait, and a couple minutes to actually draw the blood. 
2. EverlyWell - This was probably the easiest. The website where you activate the kit has great videos for how to do the test. I poked my finger and dropped some blood onto a little strip. Once the blood was dry, I stuck it back in the shipping bag and sent it back. 
3. LetsGetChecked - The website was great for LetsGetChecked as well. There were lots of video tutorials as well. After poking my finger, I had drain my finger into a little tube. This took a bit of time because it was a felt like a lot of blood. After I got the blood in the tube, I put it in the shipping box and took it to UPS.

## The Wait

As you might expect, since I had to ship them to a lab for processing, the two home-based tests took the longest time.

1. RequestATest - This result was the quickest of the three. 
2. EverlyWell - This test had the least amount of updates on the shipping back. I didn't hear anything until it arrived at the lab (which took XXXX days). However, once I arrived it was processed in less than 24 hours.
3. LetsGetChecked - This test was the slowest. It arrived at the lab very quickly, but I didn't hear anything until almost ten days later after I sent an email asking where my result was. At that point, I received a phone call from a nurse within a few hours and was given an explanation about my result. 

# The Outcome

Each test gave me a slightly different number as my result. All three of them were fairly close, but not equal.

1. RequestATest - 5.4
2. EverlyWell - 5.3
3. LetsGetChecked - 5.2

If we assume that that lab draw is the most accurate and the others should be compared to it (something that seems reasonable to most people), then EverlyWell is only 18.5% away from the "truth" and LetsGetChecked is 37% away from the truth. However, based on last week's article on HbA1c vs. morning fasting glucose, I'm not confident that we should assume that to be the case. 

Also since the prices were (when I ordered them) all within $20 of each other, I'm not sure I feel a strong opinion to continue to use lab draws for this test.
