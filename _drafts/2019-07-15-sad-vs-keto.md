For most of 2019, I have been following the ketogenic lifestyle (I don't call it a diet because that implies that I view it as a short term solution). However, since I wasn't doing as good of a job at tracking my glucose before the starting on keto (with the short exception a few years ago that I wrote about last week), I wanted to know how bad it really was for me to be eating the Standard American Diet (SAD). So I did a 30 day test. 

A couple things to keep in mind about my experiment:
1. I didn't take the time to track every morsel of food that I ate during this time. This was mostly due to the fact that I ate a lot more snacks than I was used to so it was difficult for me to remember to put everything in Cronometer. 
2. I tried to eat the Standard American Diet as much as possible, but I still had a fairly difficult time eating certain things (white bread, white sugar, sugary soda) and a much easier time eating big salads full of spinach. So my SAD food may still be more healthy than the average person's diet. 
3. I actually found it more difficult to eat at home or bring lunch to work while eating SAD because I wasn't used to this type of cooking. We ate out a lot (Cafe Rio, Chick-Fil-a, Mexican restaurants, and the list goes on)

# SAD Me vs. Keto Me

This was actually very difficult for me to maintain for the full 30 days. Within the first two weeks, I started to experience a lot of symptoms that I hadn't noticed disappearing after my switch to keto. Some of the things that came back and I didn't miss include:

* Runny bowel movements
* Constant feeling of phlegm in my throat (and a constant need to clear my throat)
* Achy joints, specifically knee pain
* Randomly waking up in the middle of the night
* Lots of gas
