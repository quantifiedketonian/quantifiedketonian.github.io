As I've been thinking about what might be interesting to my current and future readers, I wanted to be sure that I was experimenting around something that was meaningful to you. I eventually came to the conclusion that I might not be the only one who cares about glucose control. 

As a result, over the next 7 months (until the end of 2019), most, if not all, of my posts will focus on glucose control. For someone like me who is predisposed to diabetes because of genetics, my goal is to find the daily actions that I can take in order to manage glucose control moving forward.

# Why Glucose?

Many argue that glucose intolerance is the disease of the modern world. In addition to its connection to the disease that everyone knows (Type 2 Diabetes), research has been coming out that mismanaged glucose levels may be part of the cause for many other diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease[^1] and Alzheimer's disease[^2]. Additionally, higher glucose levels are one of the indicators for metabolic syndrome.

In addition to this, glucose is a much simpler outcome to measure than most Quantified Self metrics. Although many would argue that glucose is a lagging indicator and it would be better to measure insulin, IGF-1, or some other metric, those are much harder (and much more costly) to measure in a daily setting.

Another interesting thing about glucose is that a morning spot check of fasting glucose (assuming you don't have the dawn phenomenon or Somogyi syndrome) can provide a great deal of information about the previous day's glucose control. Even better at understanding glucose control is a continuous glucose monitor (as long as it's calibrated properly). But since I'm not a diabetic and don't have any doctor friends, getting a prescription in the U.S. is somewhat unlikely. I will still try though because it would be nice to understand intraday changes.

# The Experiments

I've laid out several ideas for experiments that I plan to do over the next few months. Some of them are more exciting to me than others. As I complete and post the experiments, I will update this page with links to the posts. 

* Oxaloacetate supplementation for glucose management
* Strength training effects on next morning's glucose
* Following my DayTwo diet recommendations
* Ketogenic diet vs. the Standard American Diet
* Paleo Sweeteners and the Carb Tolerance Test
* Robb Wolf's Carb Tolerance Test
* Get all the tests: HOMA-IR, hs-CRP, Fasting Insulin
* Are there any food sensitivities that can cause problems?
* HbA1c vs. 3-month morning fasting glucose (do they match up?)
* Home HbA1c tests vs. in-lab values
* Sleep and glucose: does it have any effect (for me)? 
* Natural supplements for glucose management: Cinnamon, Apple Cider Vinegar, Lemon
* Strength Training, Cardio, and HIIT: Does exercise affect the following mornings glucose?

If you have any other glucose-related experiments that you would like me to complete before the end of 2019, please let me know.
