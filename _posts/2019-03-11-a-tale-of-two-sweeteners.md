title: A Tale of Two Sweeteners - The "Natural" Sweeteners and My Carb Tolerance Test
---

#The Background:

I've now been on the ketogenic diet for two months (with a few small upticks of
carbs due to travel; it's much harder for me to follow keto while traveling than I 
expected). 

That said, as I've mentioned on my about page, I started doing keto out of fear of 
getting diabetes. So since I'm fat adapted, I figured it was time to start doing 
some of the carb tolerance tests that Robb Wolfe talks about in his book. As my 
first published experiment, I wanted to understand how two common "paleo" 
sweeteners affect my metabolic state.

Honey and pure maple syrup (none of that fake crap) were staples in our home during 
our paleo time. My wife loves maple syrup more than anything (sometimes even more 
than me, I think) and I used to eat spoonfuls of honey straight from the container 
(and if it was a squeeze container, I didn't even use the spoon; straight into the 
mouth, but no sucking on the container like they suck on the drinking fountains in 
Parks and Rec, that would be gross). So switching to the keto way of life was a bit 
of a change. 

Knowing that I have a higher than average likelihood of getting type 2 diabetes, 
I worry about adding any carb-heavy substance back into my diet. So I wanted to 
know what would happen to my body if I brought a "non-keto" sweetener back into 
my life every once in a while (like when I want to make delicious keto pumpkin 
waffles and the artificially sweetened maple flavored water just won't cut it that 
day). 

#The Chemistry:

As I'm not a chemistry expert, I hope someone will correct any mistakes I make.

I've read and heard from many folks that glucose causes an increase in circulating 
insulin in your blood (yet to test the insulinogenic effects on me) and that 
fructose does as well, but fructose is impossible to breakdown with insulin so your
body shuttles it into the liver and breaks it down to transform it into glucose 
(if needed) or, more likely, stores it in the fat cells. Sucrose is a complex carb 
that is broken down into equal parts of glucose and fructose.

Accordingly, I would expect that the glucose is the main driver of the blood sugar
spike (i.e. the higher the absolute glucose content, the larger the spike)

##Honey: 
About 82% of honey's composition is carbohydrates. Every honey is slightly different
in terms of actual composition, but generally about 38% of the honey is fructose and 
32% of the honey is glucose, with small amounts of other more complex carbs. 

I used Nature Nate's Raw and Unfiltered Honey (because it's what Costco sells) and,
according to my amazing nutrition app, Cronometer, there were 40.5 grams of total 
sugars in the 50 grams I ate (a little less than the standard 82% seen in most 
honeys). My calculated guess would put the glucose content at 16 grams and the
fructose content at 19 grams.  

##Syrup:
About 67% of syrup's composition is carbohydrates, with 90% (60% of the overall
composition) of the carbs coming from sugars. Of the total sugar content, almost 
all of it is sucrose, with about 1-1.5% of total composition coming from glucose and 
0.5-1% of the total composition coming from fructose.

I used B&G Foods Pure Maple Syrup (because it's what Harmons sells) and, according to
Cronometer, there was 44.2 grams of total sugars in the 50 grams I ate (a lot more
than the standard 67%). If I assume the same ratios for most others syrups' sugar
composition applies, then about 43 grams would be sucrose with about .5 grams from
fructose and glucose each. After being broken down into sucrose's subcomponents, 
I would estimate that there's about 22 grams of glucose and fructose each.

#The Experiment:

So according to Robb Wolfe, you should test your glucose 4 times over the course of 
a carb tolerance test: once before (a baseline fasting measure) and three times 
after eating the carb in question. Each of these times after should be based on
when you start eating the carb, with a test at 1 hour, 2 hours, and 3 hours after
eating. While researching for the article, I did come across some research that 
leads me to believe that a test at 30-minutes after may be beneficial as well (so
I'll probably include that for future tests). 

Even though there can be three (or four) tests completed after eating, the most 
informative value is the 2-hour test. You should be shooting for a value below 
140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) for a normal reading (read: not metabolically deranged) 
and a value below 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L) for an optimal reading. 

I took it a step further than what Robb suggested and tested not just blood glucose,
but also blood ketone levels. If I'm going to consider these s

I also took some notes on my reactions. Thankfully neither of them had any severe
digestive or cognitive concerns (besides a bit of nausea from the Honey)

##Honey: 

50 grams of honey isn't very much because it's so dense. Even so, since
adjusting to a low-carb lifestyle, I've really only had a few periods of high
carb intake (except for the vacations).

So eating that much sucrose and fructose in one fell swoop was shocking to my
mouth. The first thing that I noticed was a small amount of nausea (that went 
away in about 10 minutes). Also, the honey didn't taste as good as I remember. 
It was WAY too sweet.

##Syrup:

Because of some Sunday morning personal matters, I wasn't able to start the 
syrup experiment until almost 1 pm, so there may be a small confounding issue
here.

50 grams of syrup felt like a lot more (and it was a bit harder to get out of
the container I measured it in). Even though it was a lot more, in terms of volume
(or it felt like a lot more), I didn't have any concerns with digestive or 
cognitive function.

Because this was the second test in two days, I don't think the sucrose and 
fructose bomb affected me as much. The syrup was also really sweet for me.

#The Results:

A quick review of these tables and charts originally lead me to the conclusion
that I could easily eat the maple syrup as a sweetener because of the "tighter"
control of my sugar and ketone levels (there's much smaller variation between each
result for syrup, than for the honey)

However, after this next chart, I came to a different conclusion. I learned that I
should not only not eat the syrup regularly, but that I should not eat either of
these sweeteners because of how much variability they both cause in my GKI.

Based on these results (and there's not statistical basis to this yet), I have no
intention of eating either of these regularly. They cause too much variation for 
me to feel comfortable with the effects that they have on me.
